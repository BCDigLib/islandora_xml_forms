This folder contains XSL transformations. Where the file is named for the version it transforms the document into.

So if the documents have version numbers like the ones below.

1.0.xsl
1.1.xsl
1.2.xsl

It means that documents with no version can be transformed into version 1.0 by using the 1.0.xsl. Documents that are version 
1.0 can be transformed into 1.1 with 1.1.xsl and so on. The highest number in this folder will represent the latest version of the 
XML Form Definition.
